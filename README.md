Issues to be sorted out -> 

1. Go to templates -> active-members.html, there find div class="W3-accordion". Problem is that individual accordion for bio of each member cannot be opened. If clicked, only opens first bio. Please sort it out as soon as possible. 

2. Profile pic of member's is not showing due to dynamic url in img src="{{ ? }}" is not correct. Please sort it out as soon as possible. Same problem with resume download.
